This respiratory contains projects from Google cybersecurity course.

In my recent projects, I have successfully conducted a comprehensive security audit by utilizing various Linux commands to identify potential vulnerabilities and strengthen system defenses. Additionally, I proficiently employed Python scripting to automate tasks and enhance security measures. Another key aspect of my work involved documenting incidents, allowing for efficient incident response and future prevention. Furthermore, I adeptly analyzed network structures and evaluated their security postures to ensure robust protection against potential threats.
